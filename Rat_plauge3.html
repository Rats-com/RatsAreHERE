     <p>Rumors of the plague were reaching Europe prior to its arrival. It first started in China, moved to India, then Persia, Syria and Egypt. For Europe it is said that some infected Italian people and rats left in ships

from the plague-ridden and besieged city of Kapha, which is modern day Feodozija, Ukraine, crossed the Black Sea and then went into the Mediterranean leaving the plague at every port where they stopped. Once in port the plague moved inland 2.5 miles per day. The average overall death rate in mainland Europe was around 30%. Some of the larger cities like Constantinople, which is modern day Istanbul, Turkey, had a 70% death rate. In some small villages everyone died. Some of those villages would revert back to nature and only be discovered with aerial photography right before World War I. Sometimes the plague would return to the same place up to two or three times. When the plague reached Great Britain the average death rate went up to 55%. Some cities took extreme measures. In Milan, Italy if a family had the plague they would be walled up in their home. This technique seemed to work, as Milan had only a 15% death rate. Poland had a low death rate also because during the plague years they closed their borders. </p>

     <p>With all this death going on, there were a lot of bodies that needed to be taken care of. Sometimes the bodies would be buried in mass graves, called plague pits, or they would be burned in mass pyres. Some of the time there would be no one to take care of the body and it was left to nature to break it down and return it back to the earth.</p>
