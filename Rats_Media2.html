     <p>With Rats being intelligent, clean, and affectionate they seem to always be portrayed in video games in a way to make them out as vile disgusting creatures. Any game you seem to play has these poor guys made out to be bad in some way. Whether you are starting a new run in dark souls or mowing through the hordes of Skaven in “Vermintide”.</p>

     <p> Games do get one thing about rats right, their cunning and their intelligence. No matter the game you play the rats are always functioning in a way that shows their outstanding intelligence. In games like Dishonored, Vermintide, and A Plague Tale the rats have this uncanny smarts to them. They all have this level of thinking to them that allows them to work as one better than any other force in the game, while all the characters are struggling with the world they are living in the rats are thriving there brains and there hordes.</p>

     <p>With Rats being some of the cleanest animals that we live around they don’t get that same vibe in games. Within the gaming space most rats you come across are always these plague ridden vermin. From the sewers of Leyndell to the land of Helmgart rats are always plague ridden. The rats of dark souls are slowly rotting away, but one of the biggest perpetrators of this is the skaven. The skaven have the misfortune of being the main bad guy in “vermintide 2” and although rats are clean these freaks work with the god of pestilence and plague leaving them gross and disease.</p>

     <p>Rats are a social creature at their core. They way most games seem to use this as a green light to give us hordes of rats when games like “Ghost of a Tale” would have been perfect execution for the affectionate nature that rats can give. Video games should give Rats as a whole a different look then they have right now. This could allow for so much content for years to come.</p>
