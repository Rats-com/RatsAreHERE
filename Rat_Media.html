     <p>Rats appear in multiple films, but their role as main characters is uncommon. Rats in films often are depicted in many ways. Some are outcasts, disregarded by others since they are often seen as pests. Sometimes they are depicted as obedient and prioritize family above all else. And other times they are depicted as gross, vile creatures. Some films may choose to mix and match some of these traits or none at all.</p>

     <p>Ratatouille is a film produced by Pixar telling the story of a rat named Remy who dreams of being a chef, inspired by his idol Auguste Gusteau and his motto “Anyone can cook.” Remy is fascinated by food and the culinary arts while his family sees food as a means to continue living. After Remy is separated from his family, he finds himself at Gusteau’s restaurant and befriends Linguini, the garbage boy. Remy hides under Linguini’s hat and uses him like a marionette by pulling his hair to cook.</p>
