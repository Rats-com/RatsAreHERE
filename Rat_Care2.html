     <p>Where to Keep the Rat</p>
<p>Rats should be kept indoors. Rats are sensitive to extreme cold and heat dehydration, so they should be kept away from direct sunlight and any draughts. They should be placed where they can see and hear you. They are very social animals and like to keep an eye on their owners. Loud noises and vibrations can be stressful for rats. </p>

     <p>Bedding</p>
<p>A dust-extracted bedding like paper-based bedding. Non-aspen wood chips and cellulose-based chips. Avoid wood shaving and sawdust this can cause respiratory problems. Fluffy bedding can cause injury by getting wrapped around their feet or limbs. Donâ€™t add fragrance to the bedding rats have a sensitive sense of smell. </p>
