     <p>The plague bacterium is called Yersinia pestis. When fleas bite a victim, they regurgitate the bacterium into the blood stream as they feed on blood. Once in the bloodstream the bacterium eventually reaches the lymph nodes which are in the groin area, under the arms and in the neck. The lymphatic system is important to immune defense and fighting off foreign contagions. When the bacteria reached the lymph nodes, they would cause skin eruptions with blackened boils that drip puss and blood. </p>

     <p>To be fair to the rats, the plague could be passed directly from human to human, but the rats, fleas and lice were definitely involved. Bubonic plague, the least lethal form with a 60% survival rate, was caused by touching or ingesting infected body fluids. It had flu like symptoms, high fever, fatigue, and bloody cough. In the severest cases the internal organs would start to shut down and cause the odor of internal gangrene. With the pneumonic form, which was extremely infectious, the bacterium was aspirated into the lungs and almost immediately the infected person starts vomiting and coughing up blood. The pneumonic form had a 95% death rate. The Septicemic form is where the bacterium gets directly into the blood stream and sends the body into shock along with the symptoms mentioned above. No one survived. With the last version, a person could get infected and be dead within 14 Â½ hours. </p>

     <p>No one is really sure where the disease came from, but it is surmised that it came from somewhere between the Eurasian Steppe and the Gobi Desert, or the Mongolian Plateau. These areas are rather isolated and should have kept the disease contained, but communication and trade, by ship and on land, gave bubonic plague a way to move around. Rats have been living alongside human beings from the beginning of time and they could easily move around with them in wagons and on ships. </p>
