     <p>The Great Plague or Black Death was a form of bubonic plague that lasted from 1346 to 1353 and killed approximately 200 million people worldwide at a time when the total world population was around 500 million people. Bubonic plague has been present throughout all history, but this outbreak was by far the worst. The disease was spread in several different ways, but the primary vectors were fleas and lice. Now just about any animal can have fleas and lice, but the animal that has been blamed throughout the centuries for the spread of this plague is the rat. </p>

     <p>The two types of rats thought to be responsible for helping spread the plague in Europe were the Brown rat (rattus norvegicus) and the Black rat (rattus rattus) which is the smaller and most prolific of the two. Two black rats breeding over the course of three years can lead to over 3 million progenies. Rats are formidable creatures. They can climb a vertical wall and survive a drop from five stories. The word rodent comes from the Latin word “rodere” which means to gnaw. A rodents incisors grow and curve continuously over the course of their lives. Rats can chew through materials such as lead, Adobe and unhardened concrete among other things. </p>

     <p>Rats build nests, which are the perfect place for fleas and lice to live. The rat flea is Xenopsylla cheopis. A rat flea can go a month without feeding, jump ½ meter, they have a formattable bite, and also feed on humans. Lice that live on rats are Polyplax spinulosa. Lice move from rat to rat by direct contact and mutual grooming, spreading the disease as they feed. </p>
