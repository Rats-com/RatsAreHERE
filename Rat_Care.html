     <p>What you need to buy</p>
<p></p>A suitable wire cage, the right bedding, food, earthenware, or stainless-steel bowls for food, a water bottle, and a nest box. Also, playtime outside of the cage. Toys for keeping them entertained. Carrying case for trips to the vest. Could also get pet insurance.</p>

     <p>Rat Cages</p>
<p>The best cage is a wire one. The larger and taller the better so the rats have more room for activities. Rats love to climb. The rat cage should be at least 90cm in length 60cm in depth, and 120cm in height. For two to Five rats the cage needs to be larger for bigger groups. The floor needs to be solid. If it is wired the rats could trap themselves or injure the feet/limbs. Do not use an aquarium-style glass cage it does not have enough ventilation.</p>
